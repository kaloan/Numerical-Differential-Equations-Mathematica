# Numerical-Differential-Equations-Mathematica

Some numerical methods for differential equations (finite difference for ODE and PDE) implemented in Mathematica.

# Side notes
I am proud of coming up with the matrix form of RK45 in multidimensional problems (in ODERocket).
I never figured out the generalised form of Crank-Nicolson (when sigma =/= 1/2 ). Writing it out takes a lot of time and effort, so most likely I have made a mistake somewhere that I never noticed :(.
